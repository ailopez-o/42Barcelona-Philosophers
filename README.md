## The Philosphers problem

<p>One or more philosophers sit at a round table.</p>
<p>There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep. While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping; while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping; and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.</p>
<p>There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.</p>
<p>Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.</p>
<p>When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation.</p>
<p>Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.</p>
<p>Philosophers don’t speak with each other.</p>
<p>Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.</p>
<p>No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!</p>
